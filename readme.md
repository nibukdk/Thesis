Machine Learning (ML), is a process of teaching an algorithm to learn, feeding data. Algorithms try to find patterns from data to generalise a rule or relation to predict future unseen instances. Some of the popular results of machine learn-ing systems are Google Translate, YouTube’s Video Recommendation System, Movie Recommendation System. The Python programming language is one of the most popular programming languages used to develop machine learning model.<br>
The thesis introduces the concept of Machine Learning, different phases in the ML model development process and their implementation in the Python pro-gramming language. <br>
Different categories of ML with examples, typical phases in an ML modelling has been explained in theory in the thesis. Pre-processing Data, Training and Testing Models, Optimization of Model in the Supervised Machine Learning has been further elaborated using Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) as examples in python programming. 
The paper, as a result, can act as a starting tool and conventional guide to be-ginner ML practitioner. People with knowledge of python can further benefit for the conventions and alternatives presented in the coding section of the paper.
