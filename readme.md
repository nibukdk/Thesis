Machine Learning (ML), is a process of teaching an algorithm to learn, feeding
data. Algorithms try to find patterns from data to generalise a rule or relation to
predict future unseen instances. Some of the popular results of machine learning systems are Google Translate, YouTube’s Video Recommendation System,Movie Recommendation System. <br> <br>
The aim of the thesis was to introduce the readers to the concept of ML and
phases in the ML model development process as well as their implementation in
the Python programming language.<br> <br>
Different categories of ML with examples, typical phases in an ML modelling
has been explained in theory in the thesis. In addition, Pre-processing Data,
Training and Testing Models, Optimization of Model in the Supervised Machine
Learning has been further elaborated using Linear Regression and K-Nearest
Neighbor (KNN) as examples in python programming. <br> <br>
The paper, as a result, can act as a starting tool and conventional guide to beginner ML practitioner for any ML algorithms other than presented in the paper.People with knowledge of python can further benefit for the conventions and alternatives presented in the coding section of the paper.<br>
